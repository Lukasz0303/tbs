# Cursor AI Rules

## Overarching Rule: Comments in Application Code

**DO NOT add comments to application code.**

Application code should be self-documenting. Comments are only allowed in:
- Documentation files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Configuration files that require explanation (e.g., build scripts, CI/CD configurations)
- Exceptional cases where code requires business or technical explanation that cannot be expressed in the code name itself

All other comments in application code (TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, etc.) should be removed or not added.
